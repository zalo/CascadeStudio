    Optional scalar multipliers can be applied to the endpoint tangents to

        continuity (ContinuityLevel, optional):

            of `curve0` and the end of `curve1` before computing control points.
            Useful for adjusting the pull/tension of the blend without altering
            the base curves. Defaults to (1.0, 1.0).
        mode (Mode, optional): Boolean operation mode when used in a
            BuildLine context. Defaults to Mode.ADD.

class BSpline(BaseEdgeObject):
    """Line Object: BSpline

    An exact B-spline edge defined directly from control points and knot data.

    BSpline creates an exact B-spline from control points, a knot sequence, and
    optional weights. Control points define the control polygon that pulls the curve,
    but the curve does not generally pass through them. Knots define the parameter-space
    structure of the spline: they determine where polynomial spans begin and
    end and how smoothly those spans join. Repeated knot values indicate knot multiplicity.
    For a spline of degree p, a knot with multiplicity m has continuity
    C^(p-m) at that location, so increasing multiplicity reduces smoothness. Repeating the
    first and last knots degree + 1 times creates a clamped spline that
    starts and ends at the first and last control points. Optional weights create a
    rational B-spline, allowing some control points to pull more strongly than
    others and enabling exact representation of conic sections.`

    Unlike :class:`~build123d.objects_curve.Spline`, which creates an interpolated curve
    through a set of points using ``GeomAPI_Interpolate``, ``BSpline`` preserves
    the supplied spline definition by building the underlying OCCT
    ``Geom_BSplineCurve`` from its poles, knot vector, optional weights,
    degree, and periodic flag.

    Args:
        control_points (Iterable[VectorLike]): Control points (poles) defining the
            spline shape. These are not generally points on the curve.
        knots (Iterable[float]): Knot sequence for the spline. Repeated knot
            values are allowed and are converted internally into unique knot
            values plus multiplicities as required by OCCT.
        degree (int): Polynomial degree of the spline.
        weights (Iterable[float] | None, optional): Optional per-control-point
            weights for rational B-splines. If omitted, the spline is
            non-rational.
        periodic (bool, optional): Whether to create a periodic spline. Defaults
