build123d topology

desc:

This module provides the foundational implementation for zero-dimensional geometry in the build123d
CAD system, focusing on the `Vertex` class and its related operations. A `Vertex` represents a
single point in 3D space, serving as the cornerstone for more complex geometric structures such as
edges, wires, and faces. It is directly integrated with the OpenCascade kernel, enabling precise
modeling and manipulation of 3D objects.

Key Features:
- **Vertex Class**:
  - Supports multiple constructors, including Cartesian coordinates, iterable inputs, and
    OpenCascade `TopoDS_Vertex` objects.
  - Offers robust arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction with other vertices,
    vectors, or tuples.
  - Provides utility methods for transforming vertices, converting to tuples, and iterating over
    coordinate components.

- **Intersection Utilities**:
  - Includes `topo_explore_common_vertex`, a utility to identify shared vertices between edges,
    facilitating advanced topological queries.

- **Integration with Shape Hierarchy**:
  - Extends the `Shape` base class, inheriting essential features such as transformation matrices
    and bounding box computations.

This module plays a critical role in defining precise geometric points and their interactions,
serving as the building block for complex 3D models in the build123d library.
