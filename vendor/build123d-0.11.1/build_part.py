    The BuildPart class is another subclass of Builder for building parts
    (objects with the property of volume) from sketches or 3D objects.
    It has an _obj property that returns the current part being built, and
    several pending lists for storing faces, edges, and planes that will be
    integrated into the final part later. The class overrides the _add_to_pending
    method of Builder.

    Args:
        workplanes (Plane, optional): initial plane to work on. Defaults to Plane.XY.
        mode (Mode, optional): combination mode. Defaults to Mode.ADD.
