    and (for C2) second derivative of the input curves at the chosen endpoints.

        continuity (ContinuityLevel, optional):

            Useful for adjusting the pull/tension of the blend without altering
            the base curves. Defaults to (1.0, 1.0).
        mode (Mode, optional): Boolean operation mode when used in a

class BSpline(BaseEdgeObject):
    """Line Object: BSpline

    An exact B-spline edge defined directly from control points and knot data.

    BSpline creates an exact B-spline from control points, a knot sequence, and
    optional weights. Control points define the control polygon that pulls the curve,
    but the curve does not generally pass through them. Knots define the parameter-space
    structure of the spline: they determine where polynomial spans begin and
    end and how smoothly those spans join. Repeated knot values indicate knot multiplicity.
    For a spline of degree p, a knot with multiplicity m has continuity
    C^(p-m) at that location, so increasing multiplicity reduces smoothness. Repeating the
    first and last knots degree + 1 times creates a clamped spline that
    starts and ends at the first and last control points. Optional weights create a
    rational B-spline, allowing some control points to pull more strongly than
    others and enabling exact representation of conic sections.`

    Unlike :class:`~build123d.objects_curve.Spline`, which creates an interpolated curve
    through a set of points using ``GeomAPI_Interpolate``, ``BSpline`` preserves
    the supplied spline definition by building the underlying OCCT
    ``Geom_BSplineCurve`` from its poles, knot vector, optional weights,
    degree, and periodic flag.

    Args:
        control_points (Iterable[VectorLike]): Control points (poles) defining the
            spline shape. These are not generally points on the curve.
        knots (Iterable[float]): Knot sequence for the spline. Repeated knot
            values are allowed and are converted internally into unique knot
            values plus multiplicities as required by OCCT.
        degree (int): Polynomial degree of the spline.
        weights (Iterable[float] | None, optional): Optional per-control-point

    """Line Object: Jern Arc

    Create a circular arc defined by a start point/tangent pair, radius and arc size or arc limit.

    Args:

            When a limit object is provided instead of a numeric angular size, JernArc
            constructs the valid tangent arc(s) from the given start point and tangent,
            trims them at their first intersection with the limit, and returns the one
            requiring the shortest travel from the start. If neither valid arc intersects
            the limit, a ValueError is raised.
