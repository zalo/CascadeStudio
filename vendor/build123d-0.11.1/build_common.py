desc:
    This is a Python code defining a class hierarchy for building CAD
    models. The code defines an abstract base class Builder with three
    concrete subclasses BuildLine, BuildPart, and BuildSketch in separate
    modules.

    The Builder class has several methods for adding and retrieving
    geometric shapes such as vertices, edges, faces, and solids. It also
    has a method _add_to_pending for adding shapes to a pending list that
    will be integrated into the final model later. The class has a
    _get_context method for retrieving the current Builder instance and a
    validate_inputs method for validating input shapes.

    The code also defines a validate_inputs function that takes a Builder
    instance and validates the input shapes.
